/*
 * Problem : Total distance A→C given A→B = 160 km, B→C = 40 km
 * Concept : Variable definition with unsigned char; value fits 0–255
 *           so no byte is wasted — same reasoning used for 8-bit sensor
 *           readings and register values on microcontrollers.
 * Learned : Always match data type to the range of your data — using int where char fits wastes 3 bytes per variable
